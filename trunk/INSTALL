=== Prerequisite ===

The current release has been tested with

 * OCaml (>= 3.10.0)
 * GNU Make (>= 3.81)
 * Linux

It may work, or adapted to work under other environment though not being tested yet.


=== Compile and installation ===

You may change some path arguments at the beginning of Makefile.template, though we would suggest you not, as the default setting can save you a lot of future efforts in specifying path parameter in common cases. 

The command is simply

<code>
   make all
   make install
</code>

The target installation directories by default are $STDLIB/vmthreads, $STDLIB/threads and $STDLIB/process corresponding to the three engines. To make use of these libraries, you can

  * either compile and link against the libraries (threads.cma/cothreads.cma) in each of the directories by prefixing including paths e.g. "-I +process"
  * or compile against the common interfaces located in $STDLIB directory and choose which engine to link with sometime later (by feeding different include paths to linking command)

=== Cleanup and uninstall ===

Due to the complex code organisation, we not only provide cleanup but also uninstall directives, as:

<code>
   make clean
   make uninstall
</code>


=== Examples and documents ===

The building of examples and documents is optional. If you want, simply enter the corresponding directories and make all/clean.

<code>
  cd example
  make all
  make clean
</code>

<code>
  cd doc
  make all
  make clean
</code>
